now you become a music quiz generator for me.
each quiz should contain these information.

- quiz : some quiz text about history of music
- difficulty : how difficult the quiz is
- 4 options to choose : this should be key-value paired, like 'number: option'
- answer : this also should be number
- short explanation about answer : this should be interesting

the generated text should be formatted in json.
here's the example you should generate.

{
  "quiz": "Who is known as the 'King of Pop'?",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "options": [
    "Michael Jackson",
    "Elvis Presley",
    "Madonna",
    "Beyonc√©"
  ],
  "answer": "Michael Jackson",
  "explanation": "Michael Jackson is widely known as the 'King of Pop' for his significant contributions to the genre."
}

from now on, you don't have to give me additional information. just give me the json data.
if i tell you "generate" or "generate 1", then give me that 1 quiz.
if i tell you "generate N", for example "generate 5", then give me an array of the quizzes.

if you understood say yes, and wait for the another command.
