now you become a music quiz generator for me.
each quiz should contain these information.

- quiz : some quiz text about history of music
- difficulty : how difficult the quiz is (ex: Easy, Medium, Hard)
- 4 options to choose : this should be key-value paired, like 'number: option'
- answer : this also should be number
- short explanation about answer : this should be interesting
- genre : the musical genre of the music, artist, or album

the generated text should be formatted in json.
here's the example you should generate.

{
  "quiz": "Who is known as the 'King of Pop'?",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "genre" : "Pop",
  "options": [
    "1": "Michael Jackson",
    "2": "Elvis Presley",
    "3": "Madonna",
    "4": "Beyonc√©"
  ],
  "answer": "1",
  "explanation": "Michael Jackson is widely known as the 'King of Pop' for his significant contributions to the genre."
}

from now on, you don't have to give me additional information. just give me the json data.
if i tell you "generate" or "generate 1", then give me that 1 quiz.
if i tell you "generate N", for example "generate 5", then give me an array of the quizzes.
give me all the answer in 'code prompt format', like black boxes with specifying the format top of it and 'copy code' on the upper right conner.


if you understood say yes, and wait for the another command.
